# AI Agent Personal Project

This repository contains a collection of projects exploring **agentic AI systems** built with large language models (LLMs).  
The projects focus on role-based prompting, multi-agent collaboration, evaluation loops, and structured reasoning workflows.

Each subproject demonstrates a different aspect of agent design and orchestration.

## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 AI-Powered Agentic Workflows for Project Management
**Path:** `agentic-workflows/`

A multi-agent system that simulates collaboration between specialized roles such as:
- Product Manager
- Program Manager
- Development Engineer

Key features:
- Agent routing based on task intent
- Role-specific prompting
- Automated evaluation and feedback loops
- Structured outputs including user stories, features, and development tasks

This project demonstrates how complex planning tasks can be decomposed and solved reliably using agentic patterns.

### 🔹 AgentsVille Trip Planner: A Multi-Agent Travel Assistant System
**Path:** `agentsville-trip-planner/`

An AI-powered travel planning system for a fictional city called *AgentsVille*.

Key concepts:
- Role-based prompting
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- ReAct-style Thought → Action → Observation loops
- Tool usage for cost calculation, activity lookup, and itinerary evaluation
- Iterative self-improvement based on feedback

The system generates and refines a day-by-day travel itinerary while respecting user preferences, constraints, and environmental factors such as weather.
